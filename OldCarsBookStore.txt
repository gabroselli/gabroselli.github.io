I’m not going to try and nail down the serial number gap between changes in the radius of a particular machine operation or try to detail the five types of slide stops that were accepted by the Department of Defense. Oops, there I go, being anachronistic. Before the change, it was The War Department. No, if you want to track down serial number fonts and inspectors’ stamps, there are plenty of books for that. Were I to do the same thing, I’d simply be providing you with the same information they’ve already ferreted out. Not my style.We have a long road ahead of us: not just in this book, but in life and times. Some of the firearms you’ll see herein are truly one of a kind, as all the other examples of them have been lost to wars, confiscations, use and abuse. But they’re 1911s. So enjoy! &quot;<span class=”tagline”> &mdash; Patrick Sweeney</span></blockquote><h4>Check Out This Free Excerpt From <i>1911: The First 100 Years</i>:</h4><b>Gun Photos: Collectible and Custom 1911s:</b> You’ll have a hard time keeping your hands and eyes off these collectible and custom 1911s. <a href=http://www.gundigest.com/gun-photos-gallery/gun-photos-collectible-and-custom-1911s target=_blank>View Photo Gallery</a><h4>About the Author:</h4><p>Patrick Sweeney is the author of many of Gun Digest books' best-selling titles, including <i>Gun Digest Book of the 1911, Vols.

Packard Motor Car Company began its car-building days back in at the turn of the century with such a simple slogan. It is a line that has become synonymous with the legendary nameplate, and it seems so appropriate. The company was so certain that its automobile was superior, it didn't even need to brag. All it needed you to do was talk to a Packard owner.</p>    <p>In Just Packards, the publisher of <i>Old Cars Weekly</i> bring back the great machines that made Packard a legendary American brand, from the glorious land yachts of the 1920s, the ground-breaking Depression-era cars of the 1930s, to the fabulous, high-tech wonders of the 1950s. Revisit the cars that true automobile connoisseurs have admired for decades, and be reminded again why Packard, though it has been gone since 1959, will never be forgotten.</p>Z7440|Z7440|Online Gift Card $15|Gift Card|0.00||Y|http://OldCarsBookStore.com/online-gift-card-15|http://cdn.fwmedia.com/media/catalog/product/cache/0/image/120x120/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/1/5/15giftcard.jpg|http://cdn.fwmedia.com/media/catalog/product/cache/0/image/200x200/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/1/5/15giftcard.jpg|0.00|2010-06-01 00:00:00|3~551~631~6505~7785~7933~8135~8183~8189~8296~8550~8568~8581||||||||1|An Online Gift Card is the perfect gift.|<h4>You'll Love This Online Gift Card If:</h4> <ul><li>You are unsure of what to choose <li>You are celebrating a special occasion <li>You want to purchase a gift card online </ul></li><p>If you are looking for the perfect gift, purchase an online gift card!

In 1968 and '69, when equipped with the W-30 option - which included the under bumper air scoops attached to the intake hoses that fed directly into the chrome topped dual snorkel air cleaner - these cars became true pavement-pounding muscle machines. Michael puts you right in the path of these two bad boys ... giving you a dramatic low view of what makes these Holiday Coupes so cool - the under-bumper air scoops and the striking red plastic wheel wells.

This combination keeps readers and subscribers accurately informed and up-to-date on the values of their vehicles from every decade. Those of us that door-handle deep into the world of buying and selling collector vehicles can appreciate the timeliness of an every-other-month pricing magazine that accurately refl ects what&rsquo;s going on in the collector car market today. Equally relevant is the depth of the annual book that spans collector vehicle values from 1901 to 2005. The <em>Collector Car Price Guide</em> is the only vehicle pricing product that exists covering the pioneering period of automobiles and light-duty trucks dating back to the turn of the 20th century. As the author of several automotive-related books and auction/technical editor of <em>Old Cars Weekly</em>, I highly recommend this magazine and the annual <em>Collector Car Price Guide</em> to everyone needing to make timely decisions on the buying and selling of collector vehicles.<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p>U0529|U0529|Chevy Lovers Combo Pack|Paperback|37.98|25.00|N|http://OldCarsBookStore.com/chevy-lovers-combo-pack|http://cdn.fwmedia.com/media/catalog/product/cache/0/image/120x120/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/u/0/u0529.jpg|http://cdn.fwmedia.com/media/catalog/product/cache/0/image/200x200/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/u/0/u0529.jpg|0.00|2012-04-05 00:00:00|631~2417~2419~2425~4469~4475~4615~4625||||||||0|Get all the Chevrolet facts, figures, pricing and technical specs you could ever want, all in one convenient bundle.|<h4>You'll Love This If:</h4><ul><li>You love Chevrolet</li><li>You want collector pricing, data, and information</li><li>You are interested in the 100 year history of the brand</li></ul><P>The <B>Chevy Lovers COmbo Pack</B> includes:     <p></P>   <table width=400 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#ffffff>    <tr>  <td width=100 valign=top align=center>                <img src=http://cdn.fwmedia.com/media/catalog/product/cache/17/image/200x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/V/0/V0702.jpg alt=Standard Catalog of Chevrolet 1912-2003 width=90 ><br>  </td>            <td width=300 td valign=top style=background-color:#ffffff>  <a href=http://www.oldcarsbookstore.com/standard-catalog-of-chevrolet-1912-2003><b>Standard Catalog of Chevrolet 1912-2003</b></a><br><p>In this <strong>Chevrolet car guide</strong>, John Gunnell brings you 448 pages filled with Chevy models listed year-by-year along with historical and technical details.

With lots of images from Shelby's own collection, this is a book that any enthusiast would enjoy.</i>- AutoWeek</p>|<p>When Ford wanted to add some spice to it’s newly introduced Mustang pony car, it turned to former racer Carroll Shelby. The resulting cars proved to be the definitive performance Mustangs of the muscle-car era.</p><p>The choice made sense. Shelby had proven himself a force to be reckoned with on the racetrack, in the tuning shop, and in the auto industry. By the time Ford hired Shelby to create a racer from its Mustang, the man was already an automotive legend.</p><p>Early in his career, Shelby’s accomplishments as a racecar driver included breaking land speed records at Bonneville and winning Le Mans in 1959 with teammate Roy Salvadori. As a team manager, Carroll was part of the FIA World Grand Touring Championship as well as the Ford GT victories at Le Mans.</p> <p>When his health forced him to give up racing in 1960, Carroll turned his attention to design. He had a vision of a racecar made from a lightweight European chassis with American V-8 power.</p> <p>The result is what is considered to be perhaps the greatest sports car and one of the fastest road cars ever constructed: the Shelby Cobra. The aluminum-bodied 289 and 427 Cobra models and the subsequent Shelby Mustangs made Shelby a household name in the 1960s.</p> <p>Shelby continues to impact the world of racing and automobile design. His charisma, vision, and ability to know the best person for the job have made him a master organizer and team leader able to produce consistently impressive results. Even today, Ford’s premier Mustang carries the Shelby name and iconic snake logo.</p> <p>This book is the complete, authorized biography of Carroll Shelby including images from Shelby's personal collection. It's the story every enthusiast has always wanted to read.</p>U3116|U3116|Corvette Sixty Years|Hardcover|50.00||N|http://OldCarsBookStore.com/corvette-sixty-years|http://cdn.fwmedia.com/media/catalog/product/cache/0/image/120x120/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/u/3/u3116.jpg|http://cdn.fwmedia.com/media/catalog/product/cache/0/image/200x200/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/u/3/u3116.jpg|26.28|2012-05-27 00:00:00|631~4469~4475~4499~4509~4561~4615~4625~8579~8632|Randy Leffingwell|Quayside Publishing||||||0|Through hundreds of rare and unpublished photos from GM's media and design archives and in-depth text by renowned Corvette historian Randy Leffingwell, Corvette Sixty Years celebrates the first six decades of America’s sports car, covering the revolution and evolution of America’s longest continuously produced nameplate, from Harley Earl’s initial concept to the latest 60th anniversary edition built to celebrate the Vette’s 60th year.|<h4>You'll Love This If:</h4><ul><li>You love Corvette</li><li>You want to look at 6 decades of sports car evolution</li><li>You are a sports car fan</li></ul><p>In this <strong>Corvette guide</strong>, Randy Leffingwell, renowned Corvette historian, celebrates 60 years of America's most famous car.

In this book, acclaimed hot rod photographer Peter Vincent takes readers into the shops and garages of more than two dozen rod and custom builders across the U.S. From individuals crafting the cars of their dreams to prominent shops turning out cool rides for top dollar, these are the builders in their element.</p><p>For the hot rod builder, a working environment takes on a whole new meaning; and here, in fascinating pictures and words, readers learn how shops and garages inform and reflect each custom creation. The book offers an intimate look into the garages of legends like Pete Eastwood and shop such as Rolling Bones; celebrated builders-for-hire like Vern Tardel, and Cole Foster; and top-of-the-line shops such as Brizio Street Rods and Steve Moal’s operation. The result is the next best thing to being there—a book that vividly summons the nature of these spaces and the cars they produce.</p>U3121|U3121|GTO Pontiac's Great One|Hardcover|50.00||Y|http://OldCarsBookStore.com/gto-pontiac-s-great-one|http://cdn.fwmedia.com/media/catalog/product/cache/0/image/120x120/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/u/3/u3121.jpg|http://cdn.fwmedia.com/media/catalog/product/cache/0/image/200x200/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/u/3/u3121.jpg|25.31|2009-05-01 00:00:00|631~4469~4487~4499~4503~4509~4615~4625|Darwin Holmstrom|Quayside Publishing||||||1|<p>This is the story of the GTO, of the people who made it a reality and a sales sensation and of those who owned and loved the cars. </p><p><em>GTO, Pontiac’s Great One</em> includes an illustrated, fold-out timeline and photographer David Newhardt’s lavish images, which leave no detail uncaptured.</p>|<p>The birth of the muscle car revolution can be summed up in three simple letters: G-T-O.</p><p>In 1963 Pontiac's Chief Engineer John DeLorean and his two favorite staff engineers, Bill Collins and Russ Gee, came up with an inspired way to keep Pontiac cars in the performance limelight:  bolt a big engine into Pontiac's upcoming Tempest intermediate body.  Thus was the GTO born. Through cunning, resourcefulness, and outright trickery the minds of Pontiac managed to get this rocket into dealerships and out onto America's highways, and to introduce that most iconic of American automobiles, the muscle car, to the nation’s most discriminating drivers.</p><p>In <em>GTO, Pontiac’s Great One</em>, author Darwin Holmstrom explores the environment that allowed the creation of the prototypical muscle car. He tells the inside story of what happened at Pontiac to change the division’s offerings from stodgy old coots’ pedestrian transports to zoomy, hip factory hot rods. In the process, the division was whisked from the edge of oblivion and propelled to the rank of the nation’s number three automaker.</p><p><em>GTO, Pontiac’s Great One</em> includes an illustrated, fold-out timeline and photographer David Newhardt’s lavish images, which leave no detail uncaptured.</p>U3122|U3122|The Illustrated Directory of Greatest American Cars|Hardcover|24.99||Y|http://OldCarsBookStore.com/illus-directory-great-amer-cars|http://cdn.fwmedia.com/media/catalog/product/cache/0/image/120x120/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/u/3/u3122.jpg|http://cdn.fwmedia.com/media/catalog/product/cache/0/image/200x200/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/u/3/u3122.jpg|13.18|2012-09-27 00:00:00|631~4509~4563~4615~4625|Pepperbox Press|Quayside Publishing||||||1|This volume tells the story of one of the true American epics, the rise of the automobile industry.|<p>The Illustrated Directory series provide enthusiasts with an attractive, comprehensive hardcover reference book packed with timelines, historical facts and images designed to inform and excite. <i>The Illustrated Directory of Greatest American Cars</i>chronicles the greatest love story in history: the love affair between Americans and their cars.</p><p>This volume tells the story of one of the true American epics, the rise of the automobile industry.
